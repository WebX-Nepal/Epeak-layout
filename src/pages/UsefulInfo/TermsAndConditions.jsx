Travelers are required to carry a valid passport along with the visas of the country they are traveling to. We also advise our clients to make sure that the passports are valid up to at least 6 months beyond the total duration of their trip. The company will not be liable if travelers are returned or not allowed to enter the country on their trip due to the carelessness of the clients with regards to visa documentation and passports.
Booking
Clients have to go through various procedures with Epeak Expedition Pvt. Ltd in order to book the trips. Please note that the term “Trip” in the website refers to all the itineraries designed for various packages including trekking, tours, sightseeing, hikes, expeditions, and related others.
To book a trip with Epeak Expeditions Pvt. Ltd., you will have to fill up the Booking Application Form and send , it to us. Furthermore, to confirm your booking, 20% of the total trip cost must be paid prior to the trip as a non-refundable deposit.

You will have to pay the rest of the 80% (50% for trips to and Tibet) balance due on arrival in Kathmandu before the start of the trip. The remaining documents will be provided to you after completion of the whole procedures after the company receives the total cost for the trip.

Trip Amendment:
First and foremost, please note that all the amendment conditions are applied to the trips listed on this site only. Below are a few notes to take about the amendment fees in case of any changes during, while or after the booking:
If the company receives a request on the booking amendments at least 60 days prior to the trip, a total of USD 50/person is charged to the customer. However, if the customer’s request for a booking amendment in less than 60 days before the trip departure, then the charges will be as per the cancellation policy mentioned below. In case of any changes in the price of the trip during the procedure of booking and the amendments, the new cost will be applied to the trips. Please note that these changes might not be applied by the company, but can be levied upon the company by the third parties i.e. the hotels or the service providers working with the company.
Any changes, amendments, or additions in aggregation to the trips you have booked, for example, hotels, transfers, additional days, etc. will account to an additional administration fee of USD 20/booking per change. These additional charges are imposed by hotels, ground operators, or airlines and not by the company.
Please note that the amendments will not be made within 10 days of the original departure of the trip. However, if the changes are to be made (although rare), a minimum of USD 50 or over will be charged.

Children
A legal guardian must accompany all travelers under the age of sixteen. If you have a question regarding age and suitability, please contact us for further information.
Publicity
You agree that Epeak Expedition Pvt. Ltd. may use images of you taken during the trip without recourse to you and without compensation to you, for publicity and promotion purposes only through whatever medium it chooses.
Cancellation:
The company holds no responsibility for voluntary withdrawal or cancellation of the trip by the customer themselves, hence the amount paid to the company will not be refunded after the trip has begun.
If a client cancels or postpones their booked trip for any reason, their deposits remain valid until they are ready for the trip.  Alternatively, they can transfer the booked trip to others. The Company will not be responsible to refund any amount if the trip is cancelled or postponed due to clients' personal reasons or any unfortunate circumstances.
If during the trip, any services such as accommodation, sightseeing, meals, transportation, etc. included in the itinerary/trip are not used by the customer, no refunds or reuse will be provided to whatever portion remains unused on the trip. The company will use their discretion in setting the conditions for the refunds, therefore, few of the conditions mentioned are subject to change. The company holds every right to cancel the trips booked by the customers before it is guaranteed to run or an official agreement is signed. A trip is guaranteed to run once it has one fully paid traveler unless minimum numbers state otherwise.
Unfortunate circumstances such as unforeseen natural disaster, canceled flights, strike, industrial action, wars, riots, quarantine, government intervention, weather, the deteriorating health condition of a group member, etc. could lead to cancellation of trips.
The company will require a written notice in case of any cancellation. Please ensure the date of the trip cancellation is the date on which the written cancellation is received by the company. If you cancel the trip a month prior to the departure date of the actual trip, 100% of the total cost is reusable for a year. Likewise, you can reuse a 100%, 80% and 50% of the total charged amount if the company gets a cancellation notice a month, 15 days and 7 days, respectively prior to the departure date of the actual expedition.
Health Conditions:
The Company will require a well-documented medical certificate from a valid medical institute before departing for the trip. We need to be sure about the well-being and health condition of the traveler. The Company must be informed about any type of medical issues or conditions at the time of the booking itself. The company will not be responsible for any type of mishaps and will not bear the medical and evacuation expenses on behalf of the participant. Therefore, we request our clients to consult their doctors for a thorough checkup and vaccination before booking a trip with us. If necessary, a client can also make requests to the Company for additional services on the length of the trip or stay in the country of their travel.


Weather and other unfavorable conditions:
Clients should be well aware of the unpredictability of the weather conditions in the mountainous regions. The unfortunate weather conditions, especially in the Everest, Jomsom, and Kanchenjunga regions, can sometimes lead to unfavorable circumstances that include delay or cancellation of flights. The Company will cover the expenses of accommodations and food in the departing location until the arrangement of flights is done. However, the Company holds every right to reroute the original trip or transports which will be in favor of the situation without any addition in the cost. Please note that the company will not be responsible for any missed international flights, losses caused by Altitude Sickness, or any other unpredictable circumstances, and the participants will have to pay all the charges incurred. Nonetheless, the Company will connect and assist you to make the necessary alternative arrangements, but, the additional charge will be covered by the customers themselves.
Regardless of stating every condition and information about the trips on the website and brochures of the Company, we will not be responsible for the unforeseeable situations that may arise before or during the trips. The Company will, however, try its level best to give prior notice about it and take alternate strategies to deal with it. These booking conditions may only be waived in special circumstances, and in writing, by a letter from the Chief of the Company. Note that all the legal agreements set up and signed between the client and the Company shall be subjected to and governed by the Nepalese law.
Note: All the Terms and Conditions mentioned are prepared as per the laws of the Government of Nepal and is governed by them. Therefore, only the head of the Company gets to intervene and holds the authority to make any amendments.
Kindly assure that you have read and clearly understood all the Terms and Conditions involved while booking a trip with Epeak Expeditions Pvt. Ltd, and abide by it throughout your trip with us.
